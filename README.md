CS 410, Fall 2020

### Initial Meeting:
- Ask for their overall vision and don't try to impose any restrictions; it's a time to listen and not judge.
- Actively ask questions (Lead, you're in charge of keeping the meeting going, but everyone should be comfortable asking questions), and (Scribe) take notes; we want to understand and document the vision.
  * What are you doing now to solve this problem? (Try to assess and feel the client's needs and challenges and capture them)
  * Ideal user experience?
  * What did you like/disklike about the previous version?
  * Platform? Web-based, app, both?
  * Priority for platforms?
  * Key features you want?
  * Things to avoid?
  
- Think big: ask questions to gauge the scope of the project, and what the ultimate goals are.

- **Let the client know that you are going to come up with a proposal and that you would like to meet next week to discuss it.**
- **Set up the next meeting before ending. Middle of the week is better so that I can meet with you before and after.**
